## Question 1 (16 points)

Give the first six terms of the following sequences starting with the value specified.

|                                                Description                                                 | First 6 terms in the Sequence |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| A geometric sequence in which the first value is 5 and the common ratio is 75, 35, 245, 1715, 12005, 84035 |
|            An arithmetic sequence in which the first value is 3 and the common difference is 2.            |      3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13       |
|              A geometric sequence in which the first value is 36 and the common ratio is 1/4.              | 36, 9, 9/4, 9/16, 9/64, 9/256 |
|          An arithmetic sequence in which the first value is 9 and the common difference is -1/2.           |   9, 17/2, 8, 15/2, 7, 13/2   |

## Question 2 (12 points)

Write recursive functions in python that will return the value of $f_n$ term for the following recurence relations.  The test code will generate $f_0, f_1, \text{ ... } , f_9$

| Function |                             Sequence                              |
| :------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  `fun1`  |         $f_0 = 5\\f_n=f_{n-1} + 3n \text{, for } n \ge 1$         |
|  `fun2`  |         $f_0 = 1\\f_n=n^3+f_{n-1} \text{, for } n \ge 1$          |
|  `fun3`  |   $f_0 = 1\\f_1 = 3\\f_n=f_{n-1}*f_{n-2} \text{, for } n \ge 2$   |
|  `fun4`  | $f_0 = 1\\f_1 = 5\\f_n=f_{n-1}+(f_{n-2})^2 \text{, for } n \ge 2$ |

```python
def fun1(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n == 0:
        return 5
    return fun1(n-1)+3*n

def fun2(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n*n*n + fun2(n-1) 

def fun3(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 3
    return fun3(n-1) * fun3(n-2)

def fun4(n):
    # Add recursive code here
    if n ==0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 5
    return fun4(n-1) + (fun4(n-2) * fun4(n-2))

print([fun1(n) for n in range(10)]) # [5, 8, 14, 23, 35, 50, 68, 89, 113, 140]
print([fun2(n) for n in range(10)]) # [1, 2, 10, 37, 101, 226, 442, 785, 1297, 2026]
print([fun3(n) for n in range(10)]) # [1, 3, 3, 9, 27, 243, 6561, 1594323, 10460353203, 16677181699666569]
print([fun4(n) for n in range(10)]) # [1, 5, 6, 31, 67, 1028, 5517, 1062301, 31499590, 1128514914191]
```

## Question 3 (12 points)

Evaluate the following sums manually:

|              Summation              | Value |
| :---------------------------------: | :---: |
|  $\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{5}3i+1$  |    51   |
| $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{4}(-1)^i$ |    0   |
|  $\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{5}2^i$   |    63   |

## Question 4 (10 points)

Write a list comprehension in Python for each of the following.  The `sum` function is called in the test code to evaluate the $\sum$.

| Seq # |                      Value                       |
| :---: | :----------------------------------------------: |
|   1   |        $\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{53}k^3$         |
|   2   |      $\displaystyle\sum_{k=4}^{27}2^k - 2$       |
|   3   |      $\displaystyle\sum_{k=-3}^{18}k^5 + 1$      |
|   4   |        $\displaystyle\sum_{k=-2}^{7}2^k$         |
|   5   | $\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{1,000,000}\frac{1}{k}$ |

```python
seq1 = [(k ** 3) for k in range(54)]

seq2 = [(2**k) -2 for k in range(4, 28)]

seq3 = [(k**5) + 1 for k in range(-3, 19)]

seq4 = [(2**k) for k in range(-2, 8)]

seq5 = [(1/k) for k in range(1, 1000001)]

print(sum(seq1)) # 2047761
print(sum(seq2)) # 268435392
print(sum(seq3)) # 6656947
print(sum(seq4)) # 255.75
print(sum(seq5)) # 14.39 (approx)
```
